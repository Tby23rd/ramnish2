        Our goal is to create a fully Canadian atmosphere to learn English. Our methodology is that English immersion encourages a quicker learning experience with assurance of comprehension as you break down the language barrier with our Canadian tutors. Our
        teachers are all highly practiced and qualified in the English subject and reading/writing capabilities. Canadian natives themselves, they are enthusiastic to teach you from a pure Canadian perspective and offer you their experience with both
        academic and professional interactions that will help you get ahead. Our module is class-based, so you will learn alongside peers who are also preparing to travel to Canada and develop helpful connections using community learning. Locations –
        3665 East 25th Avenue, Vancouver BC V5R 1K4.active With our program, we are proving that studying English with a born and raised Canadian advances dialect, confidence, and speech patterns at a high comprehensive level. Learning in a Canadian accent
        accelerates proper pronunciation, speech patterns, and common slang or shorthand you might not learn otherwise. In turn, casual interactions in Canada  such as airport communications, small talk, or university/college professor lectures will come
        naturally to you upon arrival. Completion of our studies will ensure that you have no hesitation or insecurity about your English, and you can focus on settling in and starting your life in Canada with ultimate assurance.
